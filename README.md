This is a basic application with a .Net Core 6 REST API backend, React client and MySql.

To initiate the project, first run the `initial_setup_script.sql` that can be found under DB.
Follow up with running `dotnet restore` on the same level as the `.csproj` file.

Once that has been run, you can start the API by using `dotnet run`
You can test the API via Swagger if you want. The url should be https://localhost:7100/swagger

Have fun!
